# Covid-Data-Analysis
In this project I explore COVID-19 data from 2021 in the United States and at a global scale. This data includes information about infections, deaths, and vaccinations.

In Part IV of this project I will be uploading this analysis findings to Tableau and create a comprehensive dashboard telling a story by showcasing the data.
