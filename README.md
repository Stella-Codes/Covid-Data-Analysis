# Covid-Data-Analysis
In this project I use MySQL explore COVID-19 data from 2021 in the United States and at a global scale. This data includes information about infections, deaths, and vaccinations.

In Part IV of this project I will be uploading this analysis' findings to Tableau and I will create a comprehensive dashboard that tells this data's story.
